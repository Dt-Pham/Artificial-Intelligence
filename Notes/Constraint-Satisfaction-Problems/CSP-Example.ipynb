    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problem Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons and coding exercise will deal with several examples of constraint satisfaction problems, some of which are defined below. A constrant satisfaction problem is defined mathematically as a set of variables, a set of domains for each variable, and a set of constraints that limit which values in each domain are a valid assignment for each variable. For each example problem below we'll cover one possible choice of  variables, domains, and constraint, although others are often possible because CSPs are very flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read throught the examples, try to think of other problems fromt he real world that can be reprensented in the CSP framework-like scheduling meettings for a conference room, or building a seating chart for a wedding reception."

    "## Define Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n",
    "Constraint Satisfaction Problems can be framed as a Triple <X, D, C>:\n",
    "- `X` is a set of variable, {X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>}.\n",
    "    - dsaf\n",
    "- `D` is a set of domains, {D<sub>1</sub>, ..., D<sub>n</sub>}.\n",
    "- `C` is a set of constraints that specify allowable combinations of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "1. Each domains D<sub>i</sub> consists of set of allowable values, {v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>k</sub>} for variable X<sub>i</sub>.\n",
    "2. Each constrait C<sub>i</sub> sonsists of a pair `<scope, rel>` where `scope` is a tuple of variables that participate in the constraint and `rel` is a relation that defines the values tht those variables can take on.\n",
    "3. For example, If X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> both have the domain `{A, B}`, then the constraint saying the two variables must have different values can be written as _<(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>), [(A, B), (B, A)]>_ or as _<(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X1≠X2>_."
